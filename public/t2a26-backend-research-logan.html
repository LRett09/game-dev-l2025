<h1>t2a26-backend-research</h1>

Backends I researched: Render, Railway, Fly.io, Vercel (Serverless), Cloudflare<br>
(most of these I have not looked into making an account for but looked at thier basic functions)<br><br>

Backends I have tried: Railway (but it was a free trial which I didnt want to sign up for), and Render (which has a free version and i could sign in with github)<br><br>

Render is pretty cool but i dont know how to code the backends themselves yet.. <br><br>
